msgid "Many professionals are increasingly embracing Debian GNU/Linux, whose goal to create a rich and flexible distribution that does not require too much maintenance fits their expectations. They generally appreciate its robustness and reliability, its automation of secondary tasks, as well as the coherence brought by the strict application of specifications and therefore the durability of achievements and skills."
msgstr "为了创造一个丰富又灵活且无需过多维护就能满足许多需求的发行版本，越来越多的专业人士正投入 Debian GNU/Linux 的怀抱。他们普遍赞誉 Debian GNU/Linux 的稳定性和可靠性，次要任务的自动化执行，严格规范应用所带来的连贯性，以及成就和技术的持久性。"

msgid "At the same time, many influential actors in the computing industry have now come to understand the strategic interest of using an elaborate distribution that is not managed by a commercial entity. Some of their customers also understand — following the same logic — that a software platform that does not depend on agreements between suppliers reduces the constraints they will have after the purchase."
msgstr "同时，许多计算机行业有影响力的公司现在已经开始认识到使用一个制作精良且不由商业实体管理的 Linux 发行版的战略意义。基于相同的逻辑，他们的一些客户也意识到，不依赖于供应商协议的软件平台，将会减少他们购买后的限制。"

msgid "Finally, many beginners discover Debian through the Knoppix and Ubuntu projects, while others “look under the hood” because they want to avoid empiricism."
msgstr "另外，亦有许多既想避免经验主义又想探寻事物本质的新手通过 Knoppix 和 Ubuntu 发现了 Debian 项目。"

msgid "Debian — which used to be low-profile — was first adopted by passionate users, who were often attracted by the spirit it embodies. They found a project with clear goals and visible achievements, whose developers focus on creating a good design <emphasis>before</emphasis> building — thereby rejecting the deadlines that often compromise the quality of so many other software projects. Debian is led by its very actors. In other words, Debian users join a project that fully benefits from the advantages of free software… so as to produce free software themselves."
msgstr "原本低调的 Debian 因其自身所具备的精神，吸引了一批狂热的用户。他们发现这个项目具有明确的目标和可见的成果；开发者们在开发<emphasis>之前</emphasis>就致力于创造一个良好的设计，从而避免了陷入许多其他软件项目通常会经历的困境－－软件质量往往被截止时间所影响。 Debian 是由自己所领导的。换句话说，用户加入 Debian 这个项目，既能充分受益于自由软件的优势，又可以自己生产自由软件。"

msgid "The <citetitle>Debian Administrator's Handbook</citetitle> will guide you on your way to autonomy. It could only be written by authors who master both the technical aspects and the inner workings of the Debian project, and who know the needs of seasoned professionals as well as enthusiasts. Raphaël Hertzog and Roland Mas had the required qualities and managed to create and update this book. I thank them very much for their work and have no doubt that reading this book will be both helpful and pleasant."
msgstr "<citetitle>Debian 管理员手册</citetitle>将引导您掌控一切。要写出这么一本书，作者不仅需要掌握 Debian 的技术细节和项目内部的运作机制，同时还需要了解经验丰富的专业人士和爱好者们的需求。Raphaël Hertzog 和 Roland Mas 正具备这些素质，并努力创建和更新这本书。我非常感谢他们的工作，毫无疑问，阅读这本书将是有益且愉快的。"
